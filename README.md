Alamance Final Project - CoronavirusTracker

We built an app to help people stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Note: app is currently compatible with iPhone 11 Max and iPhone 8 Plus on portrait mode only.
Please update your device to iOS 13.4 if you want to use the app on your device.

Some core features include:

*  Home page: check COVID-19 symptoms, get daily health tips, check CDC updates and WHO updates, and use a hand-wash timer to make sure you are washing your hands well enough to kill the virus.
*  Map page: track where you have traveled in the past two weeks.
*  Places page: consult a list of places you have traveled in the past two weeks.
*  Data page: consult the number of total and new confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths for specific countries using live data.
*  News page: consult trending news articles about COVID-19.
*  Positive Test Result page: press a button to send pre-written, editable message to selected contacts to self-isolate.
